    Learner Dashboard
  </h2>

  <p>
    Oppia's mission from the very start has been "to help anyone learn anything they want in an effective and enjoyable way". The "Learner Dashboard" has been designed and developed keeping this goal in mind. If you're a new user and you have signed in for the first time, here's how the learner dashboard would look:

    The page urges you to go out there and explore: learn new things! As you start learning, the page starts to look a bit different. Its primary goal is to track what you've learnt, which we believe is a crucial step toward mastery. After all, if you don't know where you are, how will you get to where you want to be?

    Here's how the learner dashboard looks to an experienced learner:

  <img src="static/images/activeLearnerDashboard.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="A page with the heading 'Learner Dashboard', followed by a panel consisting of counters that keep track of the number of 'Completed Explorations', 'Completed Collections' and 'Subscriptions'. On the left, below the counters, there is a menu showing 'in progress' explorations, 'completed' explorations and 'subscriptions', with 'in progress explorations' highlighted. Three coloured cards representing the 'in progress' explorations are present. There is a 'sort by' dropdown list on the top right corner.">

    As you can see, all the information about your progress is neatly organized in the learner dashboard.
    On the left hand side you can see a menu which tracks different things:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In Progress</strong>: Tracks all of the explorations and collections you are currently completing.</li>
      <li><strong>Completed</strong>: Tracks all of the explorations and collections you have completed.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Tracks all of the creators to whom you have subscribed.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Subscriptions section:

  <p>
  You can also select the "Sort By" dropdown to sort your explorations and collections by last played, title, and category.
