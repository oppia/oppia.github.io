    What is Oppia?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and
    share interactive activities ('explorations') which try to recreate the
    experience of one-on-one tutoring.

    Our mission is to make it possible for anyone to learn anything they want
    to in an effective and enjoyable way.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the best ways to learn is by doing stuff and getting feedback. You
    don't typically learn to play the piano by reading a book on how to play
    the piano, or listening to 12 hours of lectures by someone telling you how
    to play the piano. Most people learn how to play the piano by actually
    playing it, getting feedback from a different person (or their own ears),
    gradually correcting mistakes and honing their technique, and thus
    improving via a continuous, formative cycle of 'doing'.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Internet makes it easier than ever before for people to learn from
    others. However, most of the available tools for this support only one-way
    communication (like text/video), and it's hard for great teachers to create
    engaging, feedback-rich experiences for others without writing their own
    program or web app.

    About Oppia
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Oppia tool makes it easy for anyone to create lightweight interactive
    activities that understand and give feedback to their learners. Each
    activity simulates a one-on-one learner/tutor conversation which depends on
    the learner's active participation. The richer the feedback and the more
    tailored it is to the learner's response, the better the quality of the
    conversation. It's also easy to share these activities and embed them in
    other web pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with any creative process, it's easy to create an exploration, but it's
    harder to create good ones -- especially since, unlike textbooks, the
    learner's answers have to be accounted for. Thus, the Oppia team also aims
    to make explorations easily improvable over time by anyone, so that the
    world can benefit.

    You can also use the community site
    <a href="https://www.oppia.org">Oppia.org</a> if you don't want to download
    and install any software. This site has all the features of the Oppia
    codebase and is a collection of open learning material that anyone can
    freely embed, share, use and contribute to. All material on the site is

  <p>
    We hope that Oppia will help increase and improve the quality of learning
    material on the Internet, and make high-quality learning experiences
    available to more people worldwide.
