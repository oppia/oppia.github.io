    The Exploration Gallery

  <p>
    After signing in to Oppia, you'll end up on the Home page. Even before you
    start creating your own explorations, there are a number of things you can
    do. You can click on the about icon at the top right corner of the page 
    (for large screen sizes) or the icon at the top left corner (for small 
    screen sizes) to access the blog, join the discussion forum or access other pages on the site. You can also check out a variety of existing explorations 
    in different categories, or create one of your own by clicking on "Create Exploration" 
    at the top right.

    The <b> library </b> contains a list of all published, non-draft explorations
    on the server. The explorations are grouped in various categories that 
    they best fit in. For example, the quadratic equation is found under the 
    category "Mathematematics and Statistics".

    You can filter the list by searching for specific topics, or selecting
    particular categories and languages. (You can also change the default
    language settings on your Preferences page.) In the following screenshot,
    the user has selected the "Mathematics and statistics" category, so
    the gallery shows only mathematics and statistics explorations.

    To play an exploration, click anywhere on its gallery tile. If you have
    editing permissions, an "Edit" option will also appear in the top right
    of its tile.
