    Planning An Exploration
  </h2>

  <p>
    A great way to think of an exploration is as a conversation with the
    learner. You might start by introducing the topic you want to
    explain/explore, then try and get the learner to engage with it. Along the
    way, you can ask questions to help the learner check their understanding,
    and provide them with appropriate feedback so that they don't get
    frustrated.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, what should an exploration be about? Typically, it will revolve around
    a question -- usually, the more specific, the better. For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the slope of a line?</li>
    <li>What are the nutritional benefits of a banana?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between Python and C#?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The exploration doesn't need to cover all aspects of
    what you're trying to teach. In fact, it's usually better and easier to
    make something basic (and non-branching) first, and then expand on it once
    learners start using the exploration. You'll be able to see the answers
    that learners are giving, and use these to add more detail as needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, Oppia can respond dynamically to learner's answers, so you'll need to
    tell it how to handle different answers for each 'card'. When planning your
    exploration, it's good to control the complexity of this branching so
    that it isn't overwhelming. Thus, similar to the above, we recommend
    starting with something linear, in order to reach a 'complete' exploration
    as soon as possible. Later, you can add more branching and loops as needed.

    The Structure Of An Exploration
  </h2>

  <p>
    Oppia models a teacher-student conversation by breaking it down into
    <i>cards</i>. Based on the learner's answer, Oppia may move to a new card
    or stay on the same one.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the initial card of an exploration may ask: "Can you figure
    out the value of 2 + 2?" Based on the learner's answer, Oppia may do
    different things:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      If the learner answers "4", Oppia moves to another card, which says
      "Correct!".
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the learner answers "-4", Oppia stays on the same card and replies:
      "You're adding two positive numbers. Surely the answer should be positive?"
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the learner answers "Yes", Oppia stays on the same card and replies:
      "I don't understand your answer; could you please enter a number?"
      (The exploration creator might then notice this and
      <a href="#ImprovingAnExploration">rewrite the question to be clearer</a>.)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note: That subsequent cards will also say something, and expect an answer
    from the learner. This is similar to a teacher asking a question of a
    student, and waiting for the answer.

    Crafting Responses
  </h2>
  <p>
    When writing an exploration, most of the work involves answering the
    following question (for different possibilities of X and Y):
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <i>
      If the person I'm talking to says X in response to my question Y, what
      should I say?
    </i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    That is, pretend you're having a 1-on-1 conversation with the learner. If
    the learner gives you a particular answer, how would you respond in a way
    that's most helpful for them? Use that as the basis for the feedback that
    Oppia should give.
