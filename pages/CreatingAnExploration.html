    Creating an Exploration
  </h2>

  <p>
    After you've played an exploration, why not try your hand at making one? To
    do so, click the "Create" button in the top navbar.
  </p>

  <img src="static/images/libraryCreateButton.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="A menu bar at the top of the page, containing the 'Create' option circled in yellow, which is positioned on the right hand side of the menu bar.">

  <p>
    This will open the Exploration Editor page.
  </p>

  <img src="static/images/createNewExploration.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="A white card having introductory content, with an 'edit' icon on its top right corner. The navigation bar reads 'Untitled Exploration'.">

  <p>
    The page asks for two things:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>A title.</strong> Pick a short, descriptive title that conveys
      the essence of your exploration. To edit 
      the title, click  "Untitled Exploration".
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>An introduction.</strong> What is the exploration supposed to help the
      learner learn?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once you've done that, a blue button will appear in the bottom left. 
    Click it to add interactions such as equations, math expressions, maps,
    buttons and menus. Click <a href="#/PlanningAnExploration">here</a> 
    to learn how to plan an exploration or follow one of the links
    in the left side bar to learn more about how to edit, improve and publish
    your exploration.
