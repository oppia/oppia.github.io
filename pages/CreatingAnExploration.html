    Creating an Exploration
  </h2>

  <p>
    After you've played an exploration, why not try your hand at making one? To
    do so, navigate to the gallery, and look for the "Create"
    button in the top navbar.
  </p>

  <p>
    This will take you to the exploration editor page, click on the Setting icon on the top right 
    corner of the page; this will take you to a page where in you fill the basic settings 
    for your exploration.
  </p>

  <p>
    The page asks for a few things:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>A title.</strong> Pick a short, descriptive title that conveys
      the essence of your exploration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A goal.</strong> What is the exploration supposed to help the
      player learn?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A category.</strong> You can select one of the predefined
      categories, or define your own.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A language.</strong> This is the language that your exploration
      is written in. (In the special case of explorations that teach languages,
      this should be the language that the exploration is written in, not the
      language that the exploration is trying to teach.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Name of first Card.</strong> This is the name of the first card of your exploration. To give your very first 
      card a name, just fill in the name here.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tags.</strong> This helps your learner discover your exploration when
      searching. You might like to choose tags that are closely related to 
      your exploration's name or purpose.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once you are done, click the green "Save Draft" button in the navbar to save your changes.
    Congratulations, you've created a new exploration!
