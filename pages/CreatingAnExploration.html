    Creating an Exploration
  </h2>

  <p>
    After you've played an exploration, why not try your hand at making one? To
    do so, hover over your profile photo in the top right corner and click on 
    “Creator Dashboard.” From there, click the “Create Exploration” button.
  </p>

  <img src="static/images/libraryCreateButton.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="A menu bar at the top of the page, containing the 'Create' option circled in yellow, which is positioned on the right hand side of the menu bar.">

  <p>
    This will open the Exploration Editor page.
  </p>

  <img src="static/images/createNewExploration.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="A white card having introductory content, with an 'edit' icon on its top right corner. The navigation bar reads 'Untitled Exploration'.">

  <p>
    The page asks for two things:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>A title.</strong> Pick a short, descriptive title that conveys
      the essence of your exploration. To edit 
      the title, click  "Untitled Exploration".
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>An introduction.</strong> What is the exploration supposed to help the
      learner learn?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once you've done that, a blue button will appear in the bottom left. 
    Click it to add interactions such as equations, math expressions, maps,
    buttons and menus. Click <a href="#/PlanningAnExploration">here</a> 
    to learn how to plan an exploration or follow one of the links
    in the left side bar to learn more about how to edit, improve and publish
    your exploration.
