    Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and
    share interactive activities. These activities, called <strong>explorations</strong>,
    simulate a one-on-one conversation with an intelligent tutor. You can try a
    hosted version at <a href="https://www.oppia.org">Oppia.org</a>.

    Oppia aims to help you learn everything you want to learning an effective, enjoyable way. So far, we've developed a platform that allows people to create and share bite-sized interactive learning material, but this is just a first step. We're planning to add new features in order to bring you more interesting experiences with Oppia.
