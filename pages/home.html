    Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and
    share interactive activities. These activities, called 'explorations',
    simulate a one-on-one conversation with an intelligent tutor. You can try a
    hosted version at <a href="https://www.oppia.org">Oppia.org</a>.

    Explorations are easy to create and quick to play. They can be published in
    the exploration gallery, shared on social media, or embedded on your
    webpage.

    Oppia supports 'learning by doing'. Your exploration can include embedded
    code editors, dynamic world maps, and many other options for interaction.

    Feedback is an essential part of learning. The branching nature of Oppia
    allows you to respond to mistakes and address misconceptions as learners
    progress through an exploration.

  <p>
    If you want to download the code and run your own instance of Oppia, you
    need to have Python 2.7 installed on your machine, together with certain
    other dependencies. Full instructions can be found on the
    <a href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki">developers' wiki</a>.

    If you'd just like to create an exploration, you can do so on the
    <a href="https://www.oppia.org">Oppia.org</a> site (without downloading
    anything).
