    A Worked Example
  </h2>

  <p>
    Let's write a small exploration to help the learner understand the concept
    of 'slope of a line'.
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll create a total of 3 cards for the learner to go through linearly.
    They'll start at the First Card, answer a question to go to the Second
    Card, and then answer another question to go to the Third Card. Along the
    way, we'll add a few responses.
  </p>

  <h4>First Card</h4>
  <p>
    To start, let's write our introduction and ask the learner a question.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click on the Content box under "First Card" that you saw when the Exploration
    Editor first opened, and type in the following:
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/card1InitialContent.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="A text area containing the content for Card 1, with a white 'cancel' button and a green 'save content' button at the bottom right corner.">

  <p>
    After saving the content, you'll be able to add an interaction. Let's
    add a number input interaction so the learner can type their answer
    to our question.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click on <strong>Add Interaction</strong>.
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/card1AddInteraction.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="A blue 'Add interaction' button.">

  <p>
    You'll see the following interaction selector. Go ahead and click on
    <strong>Number Input</strong>.
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/card1NumberInput.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="An interaction selector panel with a variety of 'interaction' options given, including the 'number input' option.">

  <p>
    Click on <strong>Save Interaction</strong>. The green box represents what
    the learner will see. They will be able to type their answer here.
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/card1AfterNumberInput.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="A green text area where the learner can type their answer. Beneath this is a button that allows you to add a new Oppia response.">

  <p>
    Notice that you can now add responses. We can choose what happens if the
    learner types in "2", "3", or any other number. To keep it simple, let's
    just take the learner to the next card regardless of what they typed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Click on the box with the text "[All answers] -> (try again)". This box
    represents the <em>default</em> response Oppia gives if it does not know
    how to handle the answer. Once clicked, you should see something like
    this (but filled in for the purposes of the exploration we are making):
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/card1Response.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="A text area allowing you to add an explanation for the card, followed by another text area for adding the destination for the card.">

  <p>
    Now this is important: the Destination section is where you will take
    the learner next. By default, it loops back to the current card,
    which means the learner will be re-asked to type in an answer to the
    same question (but, because it's still the same question, they won't be
    presented with the content again). However, let's set the Destination
    to a new card instead and call it "Method 2". Afterwards, save both the
    feedback and destination for this card. You should now see:
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/card1End.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="The saved explanation for the card is shown, below which the saved destination is shown.">

  <p>
    We're done with this card. The learner will proceed to the card
    "Method 2", so let's go there and explain the second method. We can do
    that by clicking on "Method 2" in the Destination link or in the
    Exploration Overview window. Once you do that, you'll be taken to the
    "Method 2" card.
  </p>

  <h4>Second Card</h4>
  <p>
    Now we're in the second card, "Method 2". This looks just like what you
    started the exploration with, except that the title is different and
    the Exploration Overview shows two cards.
  </p>
  <p>Add the following text:</p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/card2Content.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="A text area in which the following text has been entered: 'Using the slope equation, what is the slope between (1,1) and (2,2)?'">

  <p>
    Add a <b>Number Input</b> Interaction just like in the First Card.
  </p>
  <p>
    This time, let's have two responses for the interaction, one if the learner
    types in an incorrect answer, and one if the answer is correct. Click on
    the default response like you did for the last card and make sure it
    looks like the following:
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/card2Response1.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="A white text box to edit feedback content, followed by a green 'save feedback' button on the bottom right corner.">

  <p>
    Notice that we didn't change the Destination. This means that, if the
    learner input falls into this category, the learner will see the
    feedback and will be asked again to type in a number.
  </p>
  <p>
    We'd also like to catch the case where the learner's answer is correct.
    Click <strong>+ Add New Oppia Response</strong> this time. Change the rule
    to "Answer is equal to". Type '1', then add the following feedback and
    create a new Destination called "Last Card". It should look like this:
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/card2Response2.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="Destination card containing a dropdown list to select the correct answer, followed by a text area in which the explanation for the correct answer can be entered. Another dropdown list is present to select where to redirect the learner to next. These elements are followed by a white 'cancel' button and a green 'save response' button.">

  <p>
    After clicking <strong>Save Response</strong>, we'll be done with this
    card, so let's move to the "Last Card" and conclude the exploration.
    (Alternatively, as an exercise, you could have a go at explaining the
    third slope method).
  </p>

  <h4>Third Card</h4>
  <p>
    Once you're in "Last Card", add the following content, and then add
    the "End Conversation" interaction:
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/card3End.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="A white card titled 'last card' containing text indicating that the user has reached the end of the present exploration, followed by a blue box with a button reading 'Return to gallery.'">

  <p>
    And, <em>voil√†</em> -- you've created your first exploration! Save the
    draft, and then give yourself a pat on the back. You can always go back
    later and add new cards or refine the current ones.
  </p>

  <h3>Improving the Sample Exploration</h3>
  <p>
    After you've gotten some learners to play through your exploration, you
    can revisit it, look at the answers submitted, and improve the
    exploration based on that.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, suppose you find that many learners give the answer 2 when
    faced with the second question. On asking some of them, you discover
    that they're computing (2 + 2)/(1 + 1). You can create an additional
    response that reminds them of the slope equation and that helps them
    identify the various terms in it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, you can always go back and add new cards, refine the
    current ones, or check out answers that learners have submitted, so
    that you can improve the exploration further.
  </p>

  <h4>Example: Adding a response to our Sample Exploration</h4>
  <p>
    Let's say you've created the sample exploration above, and you know that
    learners are playing through it. To see the data captured by the
    exploration, let's go to the second card (Method 2) and see what answers
    learners have been trying. Here's an example of what this may look like:
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/unhandledAnswers.png" class="tutorial-image" alt="A list of all of Oppia's responses, followed by an 'Add New Oppia Response Button', followed by a list of all answers that have been submitted for this card.">

  <p>
    In general, these <strong>Unhandled Answers</strong> are located at the
    bottom of each card and they can help you understand where students
    are messing up. For instance, suppose you notice that for the second
    question (asking learners to compute the slope between (1, 1) and (2, 2)),
    you're getting a response of -1. This could indicate that students are
    being inconsistent with the slope equation and incorrectly computing
    (y2-y1)/(x1-x2), which would give them -1.
  </p>

  <P>
    Let's make a response to address this. When you finish saving the
    response, it should look like this:
  </p>
  <img src="static/images/tutorial/updateExplorationNewResponse.png" class="tutorial-image" alt=" A card containing the feedback and the destination pertaining to the learner's answer, one below the other.">

  <p>
    And that's it. Congratulations, you've just updated your first exploration!
  </p>
