    Downloading An Exploration
  </h2>

  <p>
    You can download your explorations as zip files and share them with other
    people. To download your exploration, navigate to the History tab and click
    the download link next to the version of the exploration you want to
    download.
  </p>

  <p>
    This will download a zip file containing the data for your exploration. It
    will contain a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" rel="nofollow">YAML</a>
    file, as well as any additional asset files (such as images) that are
    included with your exploration.
