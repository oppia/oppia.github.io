    The Exploration Library

  <p>
    After signing in to Oppia, you'll end up on the Home page. Even before you
    start creating your own explorations, there are a number of things you can
    do. Hover the cursor over the "About" menu in the navigation bar at the top
    right of the page to access the blog, join the discussion forum
    or learn how to get started. You can also check out a variety of existing
    explorations in different categories, or create one of your own
    by clicking on "Create" at the top right.

    Below the banner, the homepage contains a list of all published, non-draft
    explorations on the server. Explorations are grouped according to subject 
    and popularity.

  <p>
    You can filter the list by searching for specific topics, or selecting
    particular categories and languages. (You can also change the default
    language settings on your Preferences page.) In the following screenshot,
    the user has selected the "Mathematics" category (circled in orange), so
    the gallery shows only mathematics explorations.

    To play an exploration, click anywhere on its gallery tile. If you have
    editing permissions, an "Edit" option will also appear in the top right
    of its tile.
